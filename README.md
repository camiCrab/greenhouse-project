# greenhouse-project
In this automated greenhouse project, sensors and actuators maintain optimal conditions. A temperature sensor activates a fan if the temperature exceeds 23Â°C. A soil moisture sensor activates a water pump when the soil is dry. An ultrasonic sensor monitors the irrigation tank's water level and fills it if low. A photoresistor turns on the lighting.
You will find a version for Arduino and ESP32
